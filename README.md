# FUI Course evaluation software
A collection of scripts and tools for gathering, processing and exporting
course evaluation survey results.

## Hacking
If you want to test this software, or contribute to the project you can get started like this:
```
git clone git@github.com:fui/fui-kk.git
cd fui-kk
make sample_data
```
You will now have some test data to work with.

## KK Report (pdf)
The makefile is meant as a simple tool to run all the scripts.

If you need to download reports from nettskjema:
```
make download
```
(Not needed if you're using sample_data)

Generate statistics and plots:
```
make json
make plots
```

Insert markdown files into `./data/<semester>/md`.
Then convert them to latex and put everything together using:
```
make tex
make pdf
```

## Web reports
```
make json
make web
```

## Publish raw data:

### Mount DAV
https://www-dav.mn.uio.no/ifi/livet-rundt-studiene/organisasjoner/fui-kk/kursevaluering/

Finder -> Go -> Connect to Server.

Use script `upload-reports.py` to move html reports to the mounted folder structure.

## Folder structure

### ./data

Reports and survey answers are downloaded to `download/` and sorted into `data/`.
This folder contains *everything*, html reports, json statistics, plots etc. for all semesters.
Note that `downloads` and `data` folders are in `.gitignore` so git doesn't track changes.
This means you can work on the real data in the same project folder as you do development,
you will *not* push confidential content to github.

This is a mirror of the data folder used by FUI, without file contents:

https://github.com/fui/fui-kk-data-structure

### ./scripts
Python and bash scripts. See Makefile for example usage.

### ./old

`scripts/old/` contain old scripts which are no longer in use.

### ./misc

`misc/` and `scripts/misc` contain files that can be ignored.
